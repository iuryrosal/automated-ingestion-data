automated-ingestion-data
==============================

Your task is to build an automatic process to ingest data on an on-demand basis. The data represents trips taken by different vehicles, and include a city, a point of origin and a destination.

## Mandatory Features
● There must be an automated process to ingest and store the data.
● Trips with similar origin, destination, and time of day should be grouped together.
● Develop a way to obtain the weekly average number of trips for an area, defined by a
bounding box (given by coordinates) or by a region.
● Develop a way to inform the user about the status of the data ingestion without using a
polling solution.
● The solution should be scalable to 100 million entries. It is encouraged to simplify the
data by a data model. Please add proof that the solution is scalable.
● Use a SQL database.
